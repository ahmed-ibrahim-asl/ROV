// Pseudo Code for NRF24L01+ Radio Communication and ESP32 WiFi Setup

// Initialize necessary libraries and configurations
Include Libraries: RH_NRF24, WiFi, SPI
Define Constants:
    WiFi credentials (SSID and password)
    WiFi server port number
    Serial communication speed
    NRF24 pin configuration (CS and CE pins)
    Radio channel and data rate settings
    Radio transmit power settings
    Message length and timeout settings

// Define global variables for system operation
Global Variables:
    WiFi server object
    NRF24 radio object
    Buffers for transmitting and receiving messages
    Timing and status variables

// Setup function initializes hardware and communication settings
FUNCTION setup
    Initialize serial communication at defined baud rate
    Configure WiFi as an access point with SSID and password
    Start WiFi server on defined port
    Initialize and configure radio (NRF24) with channel, data rate, and transmit power
    Display network details on serial monitor

// Main operational loop of the system
FUNCTION loop
    WHILE TRUE DO
        Check for new WiFi client connections
        IF no new client THEN
            Check if a timeout has occurred since last radio activity
            IF timeout THEN
                Send a default "stop" message via radio
                Attempt to receive radio acknowledgment
            END IF
        ELSE
            Read and process commands from WiFi client
            Update controls based on received commands
            Send command acknowledgments back to client via WiFi
            Transmit updated control signals via radio
        END IF
        Delay briefly to manage loop timing
    END WHILE

// Subroutine to handle WiFi client commands
FUNCTION ProcessClientCommands(client)
    Read data from client
    Parse command (e.g., "Forward", "Backward", "Stop")
    Update global command buffers for radio transmission
    Respond to client with HTTP status

// Handling movement commands and radio transmission
FUNCTION TransmitRadioCommands
    IF movement command THEN
        Update radio buffer with command
        Transmit command via NRF24 radio
        Wait for and process acknowledgment
    END IF

// Function to receive and process radio acknowledgment
FUNCTION ReceiveRadioAck
    Receive message from radio
    IF acknowledgment received THEN
        Update system status
    ELSE
        Handle timeout or error conditions
    END IF
