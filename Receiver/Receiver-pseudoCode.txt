// Pseudo Code for NRF24L01+ Radio Communication and Motor Control System

// Initialize necessary libraries and configurations
Include Libraries: RH_NRF24, SystemConfig, SPI
Define Constants for timeout, message length, ADC settings, PWM settings, and radio settings

// Define global variables for system operation
Global Variables:
    NRF24 radio object
    Timing variables for timeouts
    Buffers for message transmission and reception
    Variables for battery voltage and percentage

// Setup function initializes hardware and communication settings
FUNCTION setup
    Initialize serial communication
    Initialize and configure radio communication
    Setup PWM for motor control
    Configure motor pins as OUTPUT

// Main operational loop of the system
FUNCTION loop
    WHILE TRUE DO
        Call MeasureBatteryVoltage
        Check for incoming radio messages
        IF message received THEN
            Process received message
            Send battery status as acknowledgment
        ELSE IF timeout THEN
            Indicate timeout and reset controls
        END IF
        Delay briefly to manage loop timing
    END WHILE

// Subroutine to measure and calculate battery voltage and percentage
FUNCTION MeasureBatteryVoltage
    FOR multiple readings DO
        Read battery voltage
        Calculate average voltage
    END FOR
    Convert average voltage to battery percentage

// Subroutine to process incoming radio messages and update motor control
FUNCTION ProcessReceivedMessage
    Extract motor control values from message
    IF command related to movement THEN
        Decode and execute movement commands
        Set motor directions and speeds using PWM
    END IF

// Handling different movement commands
FUNCTION DecodeMovementCommands(command)
    CASE command OF
        'Forward': Set all motors to move forward at specified speed
        'Backward': Set all motors to move backward
        'Right': Configure motors for rightward movement
        'Left': Configure motors for leftward movement
    END CASE
